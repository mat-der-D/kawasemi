//! Unified cross-cutting application error type and HTTP response
//! conversion scaffold (Error boundary).
//!
//! Scope: this module owns the single [`AppError`] type every downstream
//! handler uses to report failures (Requirement 6.1), and the
//! `axum::response::IntoResponse` conversion that turns one into an HTTP
//! status code plus a structured JSON body (Requirement 6.2). It
//! distinguishes user-facing errors ([`ErrorKind::Client`], 4xx) from
//! system errors ([`ErrorKind::Server`], 5xx) (Requirement 6.3): a `Client`
//! error's `public_message` is safe to return verbatim to the caller, while
//! a `Server` error's `source` is logged via `tracing` for diagnosis but
//! never reaches the response body (Requirement 6.4).
//! [`AppError::into_response_with`] is the extension point a downstream
//! spec (e.g. api-foundation) can use to render the body in a different
//! wire format, such as a Mastodon-compatible error envelope, without
//! redefining the conversion end-to-end (Requirement 6.5).
//!
//! This module does not open or manage the `request_id`-carrying span
//! itself — that is `crate::telemetry`'s `request_span`, wired into the
//! request pipeline by a later task (7.2). A 5xx log emitted from here
//! nests inside whatever request span is active by ordinary `tracing`
//! span/event inheritance once that wiring exists; no explicit correlation
//! id handling belongs in this module.
