//! `AccountService` (design.md "Service / サービス層" -> "AccountService /
//! InstanceService / CustomEmojiService"; Requirements 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3,
//! 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5; tasks 5.1/5.2, `Boundary: AccountService`): resolves
//! the single actor bound to a Bearer token into a CredentialAccount
//! ([`AccountService::verify_credentials`]), resolves an arbitrary
//! local/known-remote/needs-fetching identifier into an Account
//! ([`AccountService::show_account`]), and (task 5.2) resolves an account's
//! Status page via the [`crate::accounts::ports::AccountStatusesProvider`]
//! delegation boundary ([`AccountService::list_statuses`]).
//!
//! Scope: this module owns the operations tasks 5.1/5.2 name —
//! `verify_credentials`/`show_account`/`list_statuses` — orchestrating
//! already-implemented collaborators (`ActorDirectory`, task 2.1-2.3's
//! repositories, task 3.1's `AccountSerializer`, task 4's
//! `RemoteAccountFetcher`, task 1.3's `AccountPortsRegistry`). It does not
//! implement `relationships` (task 5.3) or `update_credentials` (task 5.4) —
//! those are separate later boundaries on this same eventual `AccountService`
//! type, added by their own tasks, not sketched out here as stubs.
//!
//! ## `AccountService<S: MediaStore, H: FederationHttpClient>`, not `Arc<dyn ..>`
//! Mirrors `crate::media::service::MediaService<S: MediaStore>`'s and
//! `crate::accounts::remote_fetcher::RemoteAccountFetcher<H: FederationHttpClient>`'s
//! identical rationale: neither `MediaStore` nor `FederationHttpClient` is
//! `dyn`-object-safe in this crate (both are `#[allow(async_fn_in_trait)]`-
//! shaped), so this service takes both as generic type parameters rather
//! than trait objects. `AccountsModule` (this file's own Composition Root
//! wiring) monomorphizes over this crate's one concrete production pair —
//! `LocalFsStore`/`ReqwestFederationHttpClient` — the same "one concrete
//! type per non-`dyn`-safe trait" convention `crate::media::MediaModule`/
//! `crate::federation::module::FederationModule` already established.
//!
//! ## Deliberate deviations from design.md's literal Service Interface
//! design.md's Service Interface sketch is:
//! ```text
//! pub async fn verify_credentials(&self, ctx: &RequestActorContext) -> Result<serde_json::Value, AppError>;
//! pub async fn show_account(&self, id: &str, viewer: Option<&RequestActorContext>) -> Result<serde_json::Value, AppError>;
//! ```
//! This module's actual signatures add one parameter to each, for the exact
//! same reason `AccountSerializer`'s own doc comment already documents for
//! its `build_account_local`/`build_credential_account` methods (`store: &impl
//! MediaStore, origin: &ForwardedOrigin`): this service is the one caller of
//! those methods, so whatever gap those methods have, this service inherits.
//! `store` does not need to be threaded through per call (this service holds
//! its own `S` by value, injected once at construction, mirroring
//! `MediaService<S>`'s identical "generic store held by value" shape) —
//! only `origin: &ForwardedOrigin` is a genuinely per-request value (resolved
//! from a request's forwarded-proxy headers) neither this service nor
//! `AccountsModule` can own ahead of time, so it is the one added parameter
//! on both methods. `show_account`'s `viewer: Option<&RequestActorContext>`
//! parameter is kept (as `_viewer`, currently unused) to match design.md's
//! literal signature exactly — Requirement 3's Account contract does not
//! vary by viewer in this MVP (Requirement 3.4's "任意認証" only means the
//! *token* is optional, not that the response shape changes), but a caller
//! (`AccountsEndpoints`, task 6) can already pass one through without this
//! service's own signature needing to change again once a future
//! requirement does need it.
//!
//! ## `created_at` (Requirement 1.1): closes the gap `serializer.rs` flagged
//! `AccountSerializer::view_local`/`build_account_local`/
//! `build_credential_account` all take an explicit `created_at:
//! OffsetDateTime` parameter because neither `ResolvedActor` nor
//! `AccountProfile` carries one (`serializer.rs`'s own doc comment,
//! "Deliberate deviations...", flags this exact gap and names its own likely
//! resolution: "a small, additive `ResolvedActor`/`ActorDirectory`
//! revalidation in actor-model"). This task closes that gap with
//! [`crate::actor::directory::ActorDirectory::actor_created_at`], a narrow,
//! additive method on `ActorDirectory` mirroring the *exact* precedent that
//! component's own doc comment already documents twice over
//! (`resolve_actor_by_id`, added by federation-core's task 4.3;
//! `sole_owner`, added by api-foundation's task 4.1 — both "narrow upstream
//! addition[s]" by a downstream spec's own task, not `ActorDirectory`'s
//! original task 5.2 scope). This is the third such addition, by this exact
//! spec's task 5.1, following the same shape: delegates to the
//! already-implemented `repository::find_by_id`, returns `Ok(None)` (not an
//! error) for absence, and is documented as this task's own narrow
//! resolution of a gap flagged by a sibling task rather than a silent guess
//! (e.g. `OffsetDateTime::now_utc()`, which `serializer.rs`'s own doc comment
//! already rules out as breaking this task's own "同一入力で決定的 JSON"
//! determinism requirement).
//!
//! ## Emoji candidates: `list_visible_emojis`, not a shortcode-targeted `resolve_emojis`
//! `AccountSerializer::view_local`/`view_remote` take an `emojis: &[CustomEmojiView]`
//! *candidate* slice and internally match referenced `:shortcode:` tokens in
//! `display_name`/`note` against it (`match_referenced_emojis`, private to
//! `serializer.rs`) — this service never needs to pre-extract which
//! shortcodes are actually referenced itself, only supply a candidate pool
//! that is a superset of whatever the profile/remote text references.
//! [`emoji_candidates`] supplies that pool via
//! [`crate::accounts::emoji_repository::list_visible_emojis`] (every
//! `visible_in_picker = TRUE` row, regardless of domain) rather than
//! `resolve_emojis(pool, shortcodes)` — extracting the referenced-shortcode
//! list itself is `serializer.rs`'s own private `extract_shortcodes`/
//! `shortcodes_in` helpers, neither `pub`, and this task must not edit
//! `serializer.rs` (a different task's, 3.1's, already-reviewed boundary) to
//! expose them. This is a documented, narrower-than-ideal trade-off (see
//! this task's own status report CONCERNS): an emoji shortcode referenced in
//! a profile's text but explicitly hidden from the picker
//! (`visible_in_picker = FALSE`) will not be found among these candidates
//! and so will be silently omitted from that account's `emojis` array,
//! whereas `resolve_emojis` would have found it (its own doc comment: "shortcode
//! resolvability is independent of picker visibility"). Every
//! picker-visible referenced emoji — the overwhelming common case — is
//! still resolved correctly; `match_referenced_emojis` only ever emits
//! entries actually referenced by the account's own text, so over-supplying
//! candidates here never leaks an unreferenced emoji into the output.
//!
//! ## Local/remote/needs-fetching identifier discipline (Requirements 3.1,
//! 3.2, 3.3; task text: "ローカル（`ActorDirectory`）/既知リモート/必要時
//! フェッチで解決")
//! design.md's own "accounts/:id 取得" flowchart draws exactly three
//! `Kind{id resolves to}` branches — local actor / known remote / unknown
//! (404) — with no fourth "fetch a brand-new remote" branch drawn
//! explicitly. Reconciling that with this task's own text (which does name
//! "必要時フェッチ", fetch-as-needed) and this task's explicit `Depends: 3.1,
//! 4` (naming `RemoteAccountFetcher`, task 4, as a real dependency — not
//! merely a transitively-satisfied one), [`AccountService::show_account`]
//! reads `id` as one of two shapes:
//! - A bare non-negative integer string (`id.parse::<i64>()` succeeds): an
//!   *internal* database id, minted from this instance's single shared
//!   `RuntimeContext::ids` generator for **both** `local_actors.id` and
//!   `remote_accounts.id` (see `RemoteAccountFetcher::fetch_and_upsert`'s own
//!   `self.runtime.ids.next_id()` call) — the same generator instance
//!   `ActorService::create_actor` mints local actor ids from, so a given
//!   numeric value is never independently reused across the two tables.
//!   This id is tried against `ActorDirectory::resolve_actor_by_id` first
//!   (Requirement 3.1's "ローカルアクターを指すとき"), then
//!   `RemoteAccountRepository::find_remote_by_id` (Requirement 3.2's "既知の
//!   リモートアカウントを指すとき" — a cache hit only; a numeric id alone
//!   carries no `actor_uri` to fetch a miss with). Neither matching is an
//!   error to fail through; the *absence* of a match in both is Requirement
//!   3.3's 404.
//! - Anything else (does not parse as a bare integer): treated as a remote
//!   `actor_uri` reference (e.g. `https://remote.example/users/alice`) and
//!   handed directly to `RemoteAccountFetcher::fetch_and_normalize` — which
//!   is itself already cache-first (Requirement 7.3: reuses a valid cached
//!   `remote_accounts` row keyed by that same `actor_uri` without a network
//!   call) and only fetches over the network on an actual cache miss/stale
//!   entry (Requirement 7.1) — closing the "必要時フェッチ" (fetch-as-needed)
//!   half of this task's text. `RemoteAccountFetcher::fetch_and_normalize`'s
//!   own doc comment already establishes that every one of its failure
//!   paths (transport failure, non-success upstream status, missing
//!   required property) maps to a caller-facing `404 Not Found`
//!   [`AppError`] specifically *for* this future caller (its own doc
//!   comment names "the future `AccountService::show_account`, task 5.1"
//!   verbatim) — so this service does not need a second not-found
//!   translation step here; Requirement 3.3 is already satisfied by
//!   propagating that `AppError` as-is via `?`.
//!
//! ## Feature Flag Protocol: not applicable
//! Brand-new internal component with no existing callers or previously
//! observable behavior to gate (mirrors every other freshly-added service in
//! this crate, e.g. `crate::actor::service::ActorService`'s own doc
//! comment). A standard RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR cycle against a real
//! Postgres instance (via `spawn_test_app`) is this crate's established
//! verification method for this kind of module.
